      <h2>What Even <strong>Is</strong> a Memory?</h2>
      <p>
        Memories are how the brain stores information. There are two very broad categories of memory: short-term and long-term memory. Short-term memory holds information temporarily. Long-term memory is more permanent and can last years. 
        Memories are important because they are the essence of humanity. Losing memory is losing your personality, your sense of self, and your connection to the world all at once.
