      <h2>Breaking Dawn by Stephenie Meyer</h2>
      <p class="date">Finished: July 14, 2025</p>
      <p>I'm happy that Bella and Edward finally got their happy ending. I'm sure the Volturi will probably be more annoying in the coming books though. 7.5/10 sounds like it was written for a teenager by a teenager.</p>

      <h2>Obsidio by Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff</h2>
      <p class="date">Finished: July 10, 2025</p>
      <p>AHHHHHHH!!!! I love this book and the book series so much. I've already gushed soo much about this book in my tribute to the series but I have to say, I love the little details Kaufman and Kristoff add to the story this is what makes it great!! This is probably the 7th or 8th time I've reread it. 11/10 book</p>

      <h2>Children Of Blood and Bone by Tomi Adeyemi</h2>
      <p class="date">Finished: July 20, 2025</p>
      <p>Pretty riveting book. I think Zelie and Inan deserved a better ending, in the following books you can really see how much he loves her. 9/10 book, the cliffhanger was so mean</p>

      <h2>Children of Virtue and Vengeance by Tomi Adeyemi</h2>
      <p class="date">Finished: July 10, 2025</p>
      <p>I liked this book better than the first one in the series. Amari betraying Zelie after Zelie taught her how to use her magic properly was not it though. 9.5/10 book</p>

      <h2>Dry by Neal Shusterman</h2>
      <p class="date">Finished: June 28, 2025</p>
      <p>A gripping, dystopian tale that kept me on the edge of my seat. I picked this book up in the morning and did not put it down until I finished it late at night. I love Neal Shusterman's writing, the way he uses words so effectively to convey a point or a scene. Also hits close to home because I live in California, so it reminded me about how cooked we are!</p>
